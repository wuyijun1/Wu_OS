    V2.00
    ------
    Major version update due to functionality update and moderate API 
    changes
    
    Updates:

        Blank Check
      - Support of devices equipped with multi-core architectures 
        (with cryptographic units).

          for Flash operations
      - Added robustness checks
        - 32-bit alignment check for Read command destination buffer
      - Further minor internal improvements and updates
    Fixes:
      - Read operation now returns the 1st occurrence of a SED error 
        (former version returned last occurrence)
    API changes:
      - Added command to prepare the environment (Same as FCL)
        - Need to be called after R_FDL_Init in order to prepare the Flash
          programming hardware 
            - Formerly part of R_FDL_Init, but had to be separated
        - All pre-conditions of function and operation execution formerly
          referring to R_FDL_Init, now refer to R_FDL_CMD_PREPARE_ENV
        - Note: Added a pre-configuration option for backward compatibility
      - Authentication ID handling removed
        - Removed ID from descriptor structure
      - Suspend / Resume requests

======================
2. General Information
======================

The Data Flash Library is delivered in source code, prepared for
the GHS development environment and the Renesas CS+.

Supported compiler are:

GHS 6.14, compiler version 201355 (201355)
CC-RH, compiler version 1.00.00

This installer contains the Data Flash library for the different
devices mentioned in support.txt. By selecting the correct device and
required compiler the appropriate libraries will be installed automatically.

Sample applications in this installer package are build using GNU Make for
Windows Version 3.81.
To build a sample application using the provided batch files, please install
GNU Make from the internet, and adapt the batch files accordingly.
Further more, please adapt also the path to your compiler installation in the
"Makefile" of the sample application.


========================================
3. File Naming
========================================

The installer file has the name RENESAS_FDL_RH850_T{ab}_V{x}{y}{z}.exe
e.g. RENESAS_FDL_RH850_T01_V100.exe

{x} This version digit will be incremented in case of major changes e.g. API 
    changes
{y} This version digit will be incremented in case of bug fixes and internal 
    improvements
{z} This version digit will be incremented in case of adding support of new 
    devices


========================
4. Operating Precautions
========================

All devices and libraries
-------------------------
- The libraries have been tested on not qualified hardware (working 
  sample). Following that, it might be necessary to update the libraries
  later on in case of changing device features.
- For further information, please refer to the related documentation and device documentation.
