 * MISRA Rule:   MISRA-C 2004 rule 3.1 (QAC message 0292)
 * Reason:       To support automatic insertion of revision, module name etc. by the source revision control system
 *               it is necessary to violate the rule, because the system uses non basic characters as placeholders.
 * Verification: The placeholders are used in commentaries only. Therefore rule violation cannot influence code
 *               compilation.
