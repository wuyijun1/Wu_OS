Library Changes
-----------------
    V2.11
    ------
    Updates:
        - Added F1K device group support
          - Changed the FCU RAM transfer
          - Added Code flash buffer control
          - Changed the pre-fetch size.
          - Changed the Makefile of the sample program
            Added the "-Xcpu = G3K"  in the CC-RH compiler options.
            Common object file for the RH850 devices including the G3K is 
            generated by this option.
        - Added timeout supervision
          - Added timeout supervision for library internal loops checking 
            for HW status changes.
        - Added measure and pre-compile configuration option
          - Added measure and pre-compile configuration option to execute RAM 
            code from fix memory location instead of from stack.
    Improvement:
        - Added measure to avoid unwanted error signalling
          - Added measure to avoid unwanted error signalling to an ECM during 
            FACI initialization (Only devices with ECM).
        - Misc        
          - Minor updates for the maintenance of the library
          - Added "-Xreserve_r2" to the compiler options of the CC-RH sample 
            program makefile. 
            This was done in order to support RTOS [RI850V4] V2 for RH850.
          - Delete the unnecessary "-Xreserve_r5" of GHS compiler options 
            in the Makefile of the sample program.
          - Minor updates for the maintenance of the sample program
    Fixes:
        - Added SYNCP instruction before SYNCI.
          - Solved the issue of incorrect description of synchronization 
            procedure in "User's Manual:Hardware" of each product.
        - Modified the sample program in fdl_user.c for only CC-RH.
          - Modified the assembler instruction,because a failure is caused by 
            a mistake of label reference"#".
    Support devices:
        - This version supports F1x(L, M, H, K), D1x(L, M). 
        - Customers using other than above device groups:
          Please contact Renesas regarding Code and Data Flash Self-Programming 
          support of your devices. Refer to the user's manual of this library 
          (chapter 1) for Renesas contact.

    V2.00
    ------
    Major version update due to functionality update and moderate API 
    changes
    
    Updates:
      - Added cancel request for the Flash operations Erase, Write and 
        Blank Check
      - Support of devices equipped with multi-core architectures 
        (with cryptographic units). 
        - Resulting in slightly increased number of handler calls required
          for Flash operations
      - Added robustness checks
        - 32-bit alignment check for Read command destination buffer
      - Further minor internal improvements and updates
    Fixes:
      - Read operation now returns the 1st occurrence of a SED error 
        (former version returned last occurrence)
    API changes:
      - Added command to prepare the environment (Same as FCL)
        - Need to be called after R_FDL_Init in order to prepare the Flash
          programming hardware 
            - Formerly part of R_FDL_Init, but had to be separated
        - All pre-conditions of function and operation execution formerly
          referring to R_FDL_Init, now refer to R_FDL_CMD_PREPARE_ENV
        - Note: Added a pre-configuration option for backward compatibility
      - Authentication ID handling removed
        - Removed ID from descriptor structure
      - Suspend / Resume requests
        - Old: 
          - Resume was accepted all the time after suspend request
          - Multiple suspend or resume requests were accepted
        - New:
          - Resume request only in operation suspended state
          - Multiple suspend or resume requests are rejected

    - Added F1M ,F1H support

    V1.03
    ------
    - Added CC-RH support
    - Added support for RH850/E1x and RH850/P1x
    - Authentication ID verification changed (removed result check on 
      R_EEL_Init)
    - Added accurate Data Flash boundary check
    - Misc minor updates (e.g. names and defines changed acc. to naming 
      rules, optimized some code, added comments and encapsulated test
      code)

    V1.02
    ------
    - Added new command: R_FDL_CMD_WRITE16B
    Note: Please consult User Manual for more information on how
          to use the command.

    V1.01
    ------
    - Renesas CC-RH support added
    
    V1.00
    ------
    - initial release

======================
2. General Information
======================

The Data Flash Library is delivered in source code, prepared for
the GHS development environment and the Renesas CS+.

Supported compiler are:

- GHS 6.16, compiler version 201517
- Renesas CC-RH, compiler version 1.03.xx
Please contact Renesas for information on the development environment patch versions used for testing.

This installer contains the Data Flash library for the different
devices mentioned in support.txt. By selecting the correct device and
required compiler the appropriate libraries will be installed automatically.

Sample applications in this installer package are build using GNU Make for
Windows Version 3.81.
To build a sample application using the provided batch files, please install
GNU Make from the internet, and adapt the batch files accordingly.
Further more, please adapt also the path to your compiler installation in the
"Makefile" of the sample application.

========================================
3. File Naming
========================================

The installer file has the name RENESAS_FDL_RH850_T{ab}_V{x}{y}{z}.exe
e.g. RENESAS_FDL_RH850_T01_V100.exe

{x} This version digit will be incremented in case of major changes e.g. API 
    changes
{y} This version digit will be incremented in case of bug fixes and internal 
    improvements
{z} This version digit will be incremented in case of adding support of new 
    devices

========================
4. Operating Precautions
========================

All devices and libraries
-------------------------
- The libraries partially have been tested on not qualified hardware (working sample).
  Following that, it might be necessary to update the libraries later on in 
  case of changing device features.
- For further information, please refer to the related documentation and device documentation.
